## integrated Simple Omics Data Analysis (iSODA)

**iSODA** – integrated Simple Omics Data Analysis – is a web-based application is and a user-centric for simulations, visualization and analysis of both single and multi-omics data. It focuses on intuitive interactive visualization centered around user-driven exploration of the data. 

Researchers can upload their omics datasets and access a range of single-omics modules with functions ranging from simple data visualization like volcano plots and PCA, to advanced functional results from enrichment analysis for proteomics and transcriptomics and saturation analysis for lipidomics. For integrated insights from multiomics experiments, **iSODA** incorporates Multi-Omics Factor Analysis – MOFA, and Similarity Network Fusion – SNF, and results are presented through interactive visualizations. 

A key feature of all data analysis in **iSODA** is the ability to adapt the imported data on-the-fly, enabling tasks such as outlier sample or feature removal, imputation strategy adjustments, or normalization method changes.


To use **iSODA** with the data provided by the <span style="color: #0255e9;">Neuro Lipid Atlas</span> go to the **Info** tabsheet where you can download the data and the meta data. These files can be uploaded in **iSODA**.
