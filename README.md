# SODA-light: Simple Omics Data Analysis (light version)

![SODA Logo](./man/figures/soda_logo.png)

SODA-light is a stripped down version of [iSODA](https://github.com/ndcn/soda-ndcn). It consists out of the lipidomics visualization module of [iSODA](https://github.com/ndcn/soda-ndcn). SODA-light is used by the [Neurolipid Atlas](https://www.neurolipidatlas.eu/) website to visualize the available datasets.

# Neurolipid Atlas

The [Neurolipid Atlas](https://www.neurolipidatlas.eu/) is CZI NDCN funded project to create an open-access dataset of lipidomic changes associated with neurodegenerative diseases in a brain-cell type specific manner, and identify metabolic modulators that may normalize these pathways. The [Neurolipid Atlas](https://www.neurolipidatlas.eu/) will contain data of more than 25 mutations in eight different neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, datasets will be available with how the lipidome will be affected by >100 different metabolic modulators.
