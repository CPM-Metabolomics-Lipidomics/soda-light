### Visualize data:

The visualization tab offers several visualization options for the data. Up to 4 plots can be selected to automatically visualize the data. Each plot can be zoomed-in, zoomed-out, expanded, filtered and interacted with through the side-bar menus to change parameters (![gears](./figures/gears.png)). 

- **Class distribution.** provides a comprehensive snapshot of the distribution of lipid classes across different sample groups. Each bar represents a specific sample group, and its height indicates the concentration of a particular lipid class within that group. By comparing the heights of the bars, you can quickly discern the relative abundance of lipid classes between the groups. This visualization is particularly useful for identifying patterns or anomalies in lipid metabolism or composition among the studied groups. For instance, a notably higher bar in one group might suggest an elevated concentration of a specific lipid class, potentially pointing to unique metabolic activities or responses in that group. Conversely, similar bar heights across groups indicate consistent lipid profiles. The class distribution serves as an intuitive tool for both broad overviews and detailed comparisons, enabling users to delve into the intricacies of lipid distributions and their potential implications in the context of the study.
- **Class comparison.** complementary and similar to the class distribution, it displays additional box plots and independent axes. The box plots help understand the distribution of each data point inside each bar, and easily spot outlier samples.
- **Volcano plot.** Used to compare two groups. The plot juxtaposes two crucial pieces of information for each feature: the magnitude of its change (log2 fold change, x-axis) and the statistical significance of that change (-log10 p-value, y-axis). Features on the right will be up-regulated in the right-side group compared to the left-side group; and the opposite on the left side. The y-axis emphasizes features with high statistical significance towards the top. The power of the volcano plot lies in its ability to quickly highlight genes or proteins of interest – those that are both highly differential expressed and statistically significant, i.e. outside of the vertical (absolute fold change > 2) and horizontal (p value < 0.05) boundaries. This allows prioritizing candidates for further investigation. Lipidomics only: additional coloring options for lipid classes and metadata. 
- **Heatmap.** An interactive heatmap with hierarchical clustering and side annotations offers a powerful and intuitive visualization of complex data sets. The heatmap itself provides a color-coded representation of data values, allowing users to quickly discern patterns, variations, and relationships within the data. Hierarchical clustering further enhances this by grouping similar data points or variables together based on their similarity, making it easier to identify clusters or groups of related data. This hierarchical structure can reveal hidden structures and relationships that might not be immediately obvious in a standard heatmap. The side annotations add another layer of context, offering additional information or categorization for each row or column, aiding in the interpretation of the data. The interactive nature of the visualization means users can zoom in on areas of interest, explore specific clusters in detail, and dynamically adjust the view to focus on different aspects of the data. Altogether, this type of representation is invaluable for making sense of large or intricate data sets, facilitating both broad overviews and detailed investigations. Additionally, discriminant analysis can be applied to enhance interpretability of the data. This dimensionality reduction will find the axes that best separate the different groups selected by the user and make the heatmap clusters more discernible. It will also help highlight which variables are the most important in distinguishing between groups.  Lipidomics only: feature metadata (lipid class, carbon count…) can be mapped on the heatmap too. Discriminant analysis can be applied to display the most discriminant features between the selected groups (also useful with large data sets).
- **PCA.** Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely-used technique for dimensionality reduction and data visualization. Two plots are made available through PCA: the scores plot and the loadings plot. The scores plot displays the data points in the reduced-dimensional space created by PCA. Each point on the scores plot represents a sample, but instead of being plotted using the original variables, it's plotted using the principal components. The scores plot lets you visualize multivariate data in a 3D, making patterns, clusters, or outliers more evident. The loadings plot shows how each feature contributes to the principal components. Thus, it is possible to see which variables have the most influence on each principal component. Variables that are far from the origin (center of the plot) have a strong influence, while those close to the origin have a weak influence. The angle between vectors in the loadings plot can give insights into the relationships between variables. Vectors that are close or pointing in the same direction indicate variables that are positively correlated, while vectors that are pointing in opposite directions indicate negative correlation. If vectors are orthogonal (at a 90-degree angle), it suggests the variables are uncorrelated. While the scores plot helps visualize the data, the loadings plot helps interpret the principal components in terms of the original variables. This is crucial for understanding the meaning or significance of patterns seen in the scores plot.  
- **Fatty acid analysis.** For the fatty acid analysis there are two types of plot available.
    1. *Fatty acid overview per lipid class.* In this plot you can get an overview of all the fatty acids tails found. The overview can be shown for all lipid classes, including or excluding triacylglycerols (TG), or for each lipid class separately. The diacylglycerophosphates (PA) are excluded from this overview, because there is no information available about the fatty acid tails. You can compare how these fatty acid tails behave between the different groups.
    2. *Lipid class overview per fatty acid.* In this plot you get an overview of how a fatty acid tail behaves between the different groups over all the lipid classes. Multiple fatty acid tails can be selected.
- **Fatty acid composition analysis.** The fatty acid composition analysis will give you a comparison between two groups of the distribution of the total carbon number and total double bonds of a lipid species within a lipid class. The heatmap's x-axis represents the total number of carbons of a lipid species and the y-axis represents the total number of double bonds of a lipid species. The color gradient shows the proportionate contribution of a lipid species to the overall signal intensity of its respective lipid class. The histograms around the heatmap shows the proportion of the total number of carbons or total number of double bonds for any lipid species within its lipid class. The lines in the heatmap show the average total number of carbons or average total number of double bonds for this lipid class.
