# SODA: Simple Omics Data Analysis

![SODA Logo](./man/figures/soda_logo.png)

SODA, the Simple Omics Data Analysis tool, is a comprehensive online platform designed for the intuitive and in-depth analysis of both single and multi-omics experiments. Central to its design philosophy are modularity, interactivity, and an emphasis on user-driven exploration. Upon uploading their omics datasets, users can delve into a suite of single omics modules that offer capabilities ranging from data visualization to gene set enrichment and over-representation analysis. Each module is equipped with highly interactive plots, ensuring an optimized data exploration experience. For integrated insights from multi-omics experiments, SODA incorporates the acclaimed MOFA (Multi-Omics Factor Analysis) and SNF (Similarity Network Fusion) methodologies, presenting results through equally interactive visualizations. A standout feature of SODA is its modular architecture, which not only ensures current robustness in analysis but also paves the way for future expansions
